# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game repository! This project features a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal to win. The game includes a feature for setting player names, starting a new game, and resetting the game.

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe game provides a simple yet engaging experience where two players can compete against each other. Players can enter their names, start the game, and see their names displayed in the game. The game will announce the winner or a draw when the game is over and allows players to reset the game to play again.

## Features

- **Player Names:** Enter names for Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
- **Gameplay:** Take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place X or O.
- **Game Over Notification:** Display a message when a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Reset Game:** Restart the game with a new 3x3 grid after the game ends.
- **Centered Window:** The window is centered on the screen for better visibility.
